## Introduction
Welcome to the Task 1 of COPS Winter Camp. In this task, we'll focus on the fundamentals of web development. Web development is a basic skill which is often said as a good start to the development field. We'll help you focus on the web development basics using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Tic Tac Toe
Tic Tac Toe is a game in which 2 players take turns adding their token (an X or a O) until one player matches 3 (N) in a row in any direction. After a win condition is met, the winning player gets a point added to their score and the game board resets itself.

### Objective:
You need to build a Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS and VanillaJS.

### Rules:
* The project must contain three files `index.html`, `main.js`, `style.css` and other static files like images only.
* Please note that we won't allow any external readymade templates (we can easily recognize ;) )

### Judging:
The evaluation would be done mainly on the basis of UI/UX, authenticity of the code and tasks listed below.

### Tasks:
* **Task 1**: Add a two-player mode in which two people can play against each other **(100 points)**.
* **Task 2**: Add a one-player mode where a person can play with a smart bot that never loses **(100 points)**.
* **Task 3**: Add an option for the player to choose what shape to begin with (X/O) **(50 points)**.
